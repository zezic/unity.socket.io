# unity.socket.io (calm edition)
Socket.IO implementation in Unity3d

Forked from the older (yet still functional) project at https://github.com/realityenhanced/unity-socket.io-DEPRECATED.  Examples from this project are still applicable, but to install simply download this package into your Unity assets folder.

This package is [Projeny](https://github.com/modesttree/Projeny) compatible.
